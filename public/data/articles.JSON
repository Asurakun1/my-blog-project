It turns out, it's just a bunch of people trying to fit in with the 'in-crowd'.\"***",

                "Despite the criticism, the WHO remains firm in its belief that stress is a myth. ***\"We encourage people to just relax and not worry about things,\"*** said Dr. Hernandez. ***\"It's all in your head.\"***",
